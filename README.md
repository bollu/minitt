A simple type-theoretic language: Mini-TT

I finally managed to piece together a curricula for learning how to implement dependently typed languages by recursive paper-chasing:
1. MiniTT
2. CoC from ATAPL
3. CIC from A compact kernel for the calculus of inductive constructions
4. CubicalTT from cubicalTT
